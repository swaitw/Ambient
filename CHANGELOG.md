## Unreleased (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Added

#### Headline features

- Packages can now be depended on by ID and version (i.e. `id = "viyiawgsl5lsiul6pup6pyv6bbt6o3vw", version = "0.3.2-nightly-2023-12-06"`) instead of by `deployment`. This is recommended for all future packages, as it makes it easier to understand which package is being used. See the [package documentation](https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/reference/package.html) for details.

#### Other

- `http::post` has been added to the server API to make it possible to make POST requests. It accepts optional `headers` and `body` arguments.

### Changed

#### Breaking

- Ambient packages are no longer projected into Rust code using the `#[main]` macro. Instead, a build script is used to generate a `src/packages.rs`. The intent of this change is to make it obvious what's being generated and when, as well as making the macro less error-prone. To update for this:
  - Add `pub mod packages;` to the Rust modules with `#[main]`.
  - Add `ambient_package_projection` as a build dependency in `Cargo.toml`.
  - Add `build.rs` to the project root with the following contents:
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        ambient_package_projection::generate();
    }
    ```
- Ambient will no longer update the `deployment` field of dependencies; instead, it will insert the version of that dependency, and that version is not automatically updated. The new `--version` argument can be used to update the versions of every package in your dependency tree: `ambient deploy --version 0.3`.
- `http::get` now accepts optional `headers`. To update your code, set `None` for the second argument.
- File I/O and the `http` APIs are now disabled when used on a hosted environment (i.e. Ambient deployments). To test if your logic still works in a hosted environment, run Ambient with the `AMBIENT_HOSTED` environment variable set to anything (e.g. `AMBIENT_HOSTED=1 ambient run`).

- **Packages**: Renamed the `character_controller` package to `third_person_controller` and added a `ThirdPersonController` concept.

#### Non-breaking

- **Physics**: The `Collision` message now includes the points of collision and their corresponding normals. Thanks to [@kevzettler](https://github.com/kevzettler) for fixing this in [#1107](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/1107)!
- **Pipeline Types**: A few extra types have been exported. Thanks to [@kevzettler](https://github.com/kevzettler) for fixing this in [#1082](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/1082)!

### Fixed

- **Debugger**: The debugger has now been re-enabled.
- **CLI**: Released `crates.io` versions are now used as the API dependency in a new project instead of git tags of the Ambient repository.
- **Rendering**: Fixed 3D line drawing when they're behind the camera.
- **Networking**: The send queue is now compacted during send to reduce queue growth when backlogged by a slow player connection.
- **Web**: The web client will now update its size when the window is resized.
- **Rendering**: Fixed an issue where a black border would appear around solid objects with an alpha cutoff ([#1104](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/1104)).

### Added

#### Headline features

- **Client**: The client can now **run on the web**.
- **Deploy**: The `ambient deploy` command can now be used to deploy a package to Ambient runtime services.
- **Audio**: Spatial audio is now supported for 3D sounds. See the [physics example](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/blob/main/guest/rust/examples/physics/basics/src/client.rs) and [first_person_camera example](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/blob/main/guest/rust/examples/controllers/first_person_camera/src/client.rs)
- **Networking**: The networking protocol now supports WebTransport for the web client.
- **Rendering**: Procedural meshes, textures, samplers and materials are now supported on the client. See the [procedural generation example](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/tree/main/guest/rust/examples/rendering/procedural_generation).
- **Semantics**: A semantic system to connect packages (previously projects) has been added. This enables dependencies, enums and more. See the breaking changes for more details.

#### Other

- **UI**: Added a new `ImageFromUrl` element, which can load images from assets or URLs. It also supports rounded corners, borders and a fallback background color. See the [image example](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/blob/main/guest/rust/examples/ui/image/src/client.rs) for more details.
- **Rendering**: Added a `torus` primitive. Thanks to [@mebyz](https://github.com/mebyz) for implementing this in [#376](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/376)!
- **Physics**: Add `set_character_controller_position` to the `physics` API. Thanks to [@devjobe](https://github.com/devjobe) for implementing this in [#398](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/398).
- **ECS**: `Duration` is now a supported primitive type.
- **ECS**: All integer types from 8-bit to 64-bit are now supported as component types, including signed and unsigned variants. Additionally, all signed and unsigned integer vector types are now supported. This includes `U16`, `IVec2`, `UVec3`, etc.
- **Docs**: The IDE documentation has been improved, including information on how to set up Emacs for Ambient development (thanks to [@kevzettler](https://github.com/kevzettler) in [#505](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/505)).
- **Assets**: `ambient assets import` can be used to import assets one by one. This will create or modify the `pipeline.toml` file for you.
- **Camera**: Added `camera::get_active` to get the active camera.
- **Client**: When using the native client, you can now use `--window-x` and `--window-y` to specify the window position, as well as `--window-width` and `--window-height` to specify the window size.
- **Packages**: A set of standard packages have been added. Explore `guest/rust/packages` to find them. These include a character controller, a focus-grabber, a package manager, and more.
- **Packages**: Several sample games have been added, including `tangent`, `arkanoid`, `pong`, and more.
- **Examples**: Examples have been added for new functionality, including `clock`, `audio_ctrl`, `dependencies`, and more.
- **Debugging**: Sentry has been added to the client and server to automatically report crashes. This can be disabled in Ambient's `settings.toml`.

#### Breaking

- **Examples**: Examples have been rearranged to be more discoverable. They are now grouped by category.
- **Project**: Projects have been renamed to Packages; see the [package documentation](https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/reference/package.html) for details.
- **Package**: As mentioned above, a new package semantic system has been added. This comes with several breaking changes:

  - In your Rust code:

    - The modules generated by the Ambient macro are now different in shape. They are namespaced, with each item being present in the namespace as a separate module within the `packages` module, where your package is `this`. For example:
      - `components::my_component` -> `packages::this::components::my_component`
      - `ambient_api::components::core::app::main_scene` -> `ambient_api::core::app::components::main_scene`
      - a dependency `cool_dependency = { path = "somewhere" }` -> `packages::cool_dependency::components::my_component` (i.e. the name used for the import is used, not the package ID)
    - `asset::url` has been removed; instead, each package now introduces an `assets` module, allowing you to access that package's assets directly. For example:
      - `asset::url("assets/Teapot.glb").unwrap()` -> `packages::ambient_example_asset_loading::assets::url("Teapot.glb")`
    - UI layout components now use enums to specify their alignment. For example:
      - `with_default(fit_vertical_none())` -> `with(fit_vertical(), Fit::None)`
    - Messages now preserve the order of their fields.
      - If your fields are `a, c, b`, they will be in that order in the generated code.
      - Previously, they were sorted alphabetically.

  - In your `ambient.toml`:

    - Specifying a `version` is now mandatory.
    - Specifying a `content` is now mandatory.
    - Messages now have PascalCase IDs:
      - `messages.set_controller` -> `messages.SetController`
    - Enums are now supported; they are defined as follows, and can be used anywhere a primitive type can be used, including components and messages.

      ```toml
      [enums.Layout]
      description = "The type of the layout to use."
      [enums.Layout.members]
      Flow = "Bottom-up flow layout."
      Dock = "Top-down dock layout."
      Bookcase = "Min-max bookcase layout."
      WidthToChildren = "Width to children."

      [components]
      layout = { type = "Layout" }
      ```

    - Packages can now depend on other packages, allowing for access to their components, messages, etc. This is done by adding a `dependencies` section to your package. For example:

      ```toml
      [dependencies]
      my_cool_package = { path = "cool_package" }
      ```

      This will allow you to access the components, messages, etc. of the `my_cool_package` package from your package. The name that you use to import the package will be used as the namespace, not the package's original ID.

- **Components**: Several "tag components" have been prefixed with `is_` to indicate their tag nature. These include:

  - `core::animation::animation_player` -> `core::animation::is_animation_player`
  - `core::audio::audio_player` -> `core::audio::is_audio_player`
  - `core::audio::spatial_audio_player` -> `core::audio::is_spatial_audio_player`
  - `core::layout::screen` -> `core::layout::is_screen`
  - `core::network::persistent_resources` -> `core::network::is_persistent_resources`
  - `core::network::synced_resources` -> `core::network::is_synced_resources`
  - `core::player::player` -> `core::player::is_player`
  - `core::wasm::module` -> `core::wasm::is_module`
  - `core::wasm::module_on_server` -> `core::wasm::is_module_on_server`

- **API**: Locally-broadcasted messages can now choose to include the originating module in the broadcast; this is an additional boolean parameter to `ModuleMessage::send_local_broadcast` and `message::Target::LocalBroadcast`.
- **Camera**: Renamed `screen_to_world_direction` to `screen_position_to_world_ray` and `clip_space_ray` to `clip_position_to_world_ray`. See [#410](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/issues/410).
- **Package**: `type = { type = "Vec3" }` is no longer valid syntax in `ambient.toml`. Only `type = "Vec3"` and `type = { type = "Vec", element-type = "Vec3" }` are valid.
- **Physics**: Renamed the `visualizing` component to `visualize_collider`.
- **Animation**: The animation system has been reworked. See the [animation documentation](https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/reference/animations.html) for details. Thanks to [@devjobe](https://github.com/devjobe) for laying the foundation for this!
- **Physics**: Renamed `box_collider` to `cube_collider`.
- **API**: The `time` function has been split into `game_time` and `epoch_time`. The `dtime` component has been renamed to `delta_time`. The `frametime` function has been renamed to `delta_time`.
- **Assets**: Asset pipelines now use TOML instead of JSON. Use the `ambient assets migrate-pipelines-toml` command to migrate. (Note that this command will be removed in the next release.)
- **API**: Removed `Entity::with_default` due to its confusing behaviour (Rust defaults are not necessarily the same as component or concept defaults). You will now have to explicitly specify a value for each component.
- **API**: `entity::wait_for_component` is now marked as `must_use` to ensure users consider the possibility of the entity being despawned.
- **Elements**: All hooks are now free functions (i.e. `use_state(hooks, ..)` instead of `hooks.use_state(..)`)
- **UI**: Focus is now global across different packages, including the removal of the `FocusRoot` element component.
- **Hierarchies**: The `children` component is now automatically derived from `parent` components (unless the user opts out of this). The `children` component is also no longer networked, as it is automatically derived on the client.
- **Concepts**: Concept code generation has been changed to generate `structs` instead, as well as adding support for optional components. See the documentation for more information.

#### Non-breaking

- **Logging**: The logging output levels have been tweaked to better communicate the state of the system at any given time.
- **Debugger**: The debugger has been improved with a resizable sidebar, a scrollable view, and a component filter.
- **Animation**: The animation graph is now executed on the server as well.
- **CLI**: The `ambient new` command now takes several parameters to customize the resulting generation.
- **Rendering**: The renderer now runs using the direct pipeline on all architectures. This is temporary until platform-specific issues with the multi-draw indirect pipeline are addressed.

### Fixed

- **Rendering**: Skinned meshes will no longer be corrupted when there is more than one skinned mesh in a mesh buffer.
- **UI**: `TextEditor` will no longer capture input even when it is not visible.
- **Rendering**: Decals now render more consistently.
- **API**: `entity::wait_for_component` will now exit if the entity is despawned.
- **API**: The `message::Source` methods no longer consume the source when returning their data.
- **Rendering**: Lines with a `from` located after a `to` on the X-dimension will now render correctly.
- **API**: The `entity::mutate_component` documentation now refers to the correct parameter. Thanks to [@aldzban](https://github.com/aldzban) for fixing this in [#482](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/482).
- **UI**: The `ScrollArea` now has a scroll bar.
- **Input**: Input is now cleared when the window loses focus, preventing "stuck input" bugs.
- **UI**: Layout-related properties, like alignment and fit, did not work correctly for certain values. This has been fixed with the introduction of enums.
- **Player**: Player entities are now recursively despawned when disconnecting.
- **Build**: Rust compilation errors are now more readable with more colors and fewer unused warnings.
- **ECS**: The `transformable` concept now includes `local_to_world` to ensure that the world transform is always available.
- **Physics**: The `physics::raycast[_first]` functions will now validate the direction to ensure that they are non-zero, non-NaN and normalized.
- **Rendering**: Removing the `outline_recursive` component from a entity will now remove the outline from its children as well.
- **API**: The `ambient_ui` prelude (and the `ambient_api` prelude, by extension) no longer glob-imports components into the global namespace. This means that you will need to import components explicitly.
- **Messaging**: Messages without empty fields now generate a unit struct, instead of a struct with no fields. That is, they generate `struct MyMessage;` instead of `struct MyMessage {}`.
- **Physics**: Child collision volumes are now automatically updated when their parent's transform changes. Thanks to [@kevzettler](https://github.com/kevzettler) for fixing this in [#885](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/pull/885)!

### Changed

#### Breaking

- **Client**: `--debug` is now `--debugger`, but it can also be accessed through the `AMBIENT_DEBUGGER` env variable.
- **API**: The `Cargo.toml` has changed to enable clientside builds. Please look at the examples to see how to update your `Cargo.toml` appropriately.
