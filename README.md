Ambient is an open-source cross-platform runtime and platform for building, deploying and sharing high-performance multiplayer games on the web, desktop, and elsewhere. Powered by Rust, WebAssembly (WASM), and WebGPU, Ambient is cutting-edge while staying true to its goal: making game development both fun and accessible.

The Ambient runtime itself is an extensible multiplayer game engine with an [in-game real-time database](https://ambient.run/docs/reference/ecs), [automatic synchronization](https://ambient.run/docs/reference/networking), [Rust-inspired interoperable packages](https://ambient.run/docs/reference/package), [configurable asset pipelines](https://ambient.run/docs/reference/asset_pipeline), WASM-powered isolation, PBR rendering, and more.
