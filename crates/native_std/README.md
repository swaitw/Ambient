# Ambient native STD

Ambient native STD is a collection of low level functions and types; think of it as a gamedev complement to the rust-std library.

~~This is the "lowest level" library and shouldn't depend on any other Ambient crate~~. See `ambient_std` for something that can be used in all contexts.
