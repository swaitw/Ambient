/// Defines the behavior of an [`Interval`] when it misses a tick.
///
/// Sometimes, an [`Interval`]'s tick is missed. For example, consider the
/// following:
///
/// ```
/// use ambient_sys::time::{self, Duration};
/// # async fn task_that_takes_one_to_three_millis() {}
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() {
///     // ticks every 2 milliseconds
///     let mut interval = time::interval(Duration::from_millis(2));
///     for _ in 0..5 {
///         interval.tick().await;
///         // if this takes more than 2 milliseconds, a tick will be delayed
///         task_that_takes_one_to_three_millis().await;
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Generally, a tick is missed if too much time is spent without calling
/// [`Interval::tick()`].
///
/// By default, when a tick is missed, [`Interval`] fires ticks as quickly as it
/// can until it is "caught up" in time to where it should be.
/// `MissedTickBehavior` can be used to specify a different behavior for
/// [`Interval`] to exhibit. Each variant represents a different strategy.
///
/// Note that because the executor cannot guarantee exact precision with timers,
/// these strategies will only apply when the delay is greater than 5
/// milliseconds.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum MissedTickBehavior {
    /// Ticks as fast as possible until caught up.
    ///
    /// When this strategy is used, [`Interval`] schedules ticks "normally" (the
    /// same as it would have if the ticks hadn't been delayed), which results
    /// in it firing ticks as fast as possible until it is caught up in time to
    /// where it should be. Unlike [`Delay`] and [`Skip`], the ticks yielded
    /// when `Burst` is used (the [`Instant`]s that [`tick`](Interval::tick)
    /// yields) aren't different than they would have been if a tick had not
    /// been missed. Like [`Skip`], and unlike [`Delay`], the ticks may be
    /// shortened.
