# Asset pipeline

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD024 -->

Ambient features an automated asset pipeline that is capable of loading and processing a number of assets and formats.

Within the `assets` folder, or any subdirectory of it, create a file with a name ending in `pipeline.toml`; examples include `pipeline.toml` and `hello_pipeline.toml`. The prefix can be used to disambiguate between different pipelines.

This pipelines will look at, but not necessarily process, all of the files adjacent to it in the folder.

## Models

The `Models` pipeline can be used to compile a model, or models, to meshes that can be used by Ambient. Additionally, by
default, prefabs are created for each mesh. These prefabs can have components automatically added to them through the
`prefab_components` field of the pipeline.

### Supported formats

- FBX: Native support
- glTF: Native support
- Unity models: Native support
- Quixel models: Native support
- ~30 other formats: This support is provided through the [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) library. It is not
  guaranteed to be fully integrated. By default, Ambient is not built with `assimp` support due to issues with cross-platform builds.

### Examples

#### Basic models

The following will load `.glb` and `.fbx` files in the folder or any of the sub-folders.

```toml
[[pipelines]]
type = "Models"
```

#### Different pipelines for different files

You can use the `sources` attribute to restrict different configurations to different files:

```toml
[[pipelines]]
type = "Models"
sources = [ "physical/*.glb" ]

[pipelines.collider]
type = "FromModel"

[[pipelines]]
type = "Models"
sources = [ "ghosts/*.glb" ]
```

`sources` accepts a list of glob patterns, so you can target a single file or a pattern to select all files in a
directory (`*.glb`) or sub-tree (`**/test.glb`).

#### Combining a model with textures

The following example is the asset pipeline for the [`material_overriding` example](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/tree/main/guest/rust/examples/assets/material_overriding). It applies a custom material to
the imported mesh.

```toml
{{ #include ../../../guest/rust/examples/assets/material_overriding/assets/pipeline.toml }}
```

#### Generating a pipeline in code

By using a build script, you can also generate a `pipeline.toml` using Rust code. For instance with a `build.rs` like this:

```rust
{{ #include ../../../guest/rust/examples/assets/generate_pipeline/build.rs }}
```

Which will generate the following toml:

```toml
{{ #include ../../../guest/rust/examples/assets/generate_pipeline/assets/pipeline.toml }}
```

See the [generate pipeline example](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/tree/main/guest/rust/examples/assets/generate_pipeline) for a full example.

### Notes

- If you are using components in your prefab and are hot-reloading it, the incoming prefab will overwrite any
  corresponding components on the current state of the entity. These components should only be used for static data - that
  is, `max_hitpoints` but not `current_hitpoints`.

## Models

### Regular

Consumes model file formats into a hierarchy of entities, materials, and meshes.

#### Supported formats:

- `glb`
- `gltf`
- `fbx`
- `obj`

### Unity

Consumes Unity packages processing all meshes, textures and materials, and LoD levels into a normalized form to consume in Ambient.
Usage of a processed model during runtime is identical to `Regular`.

### Quixel

Imports Quixel packages.

Supports collections, LoD levels, etc.

## Materials

Import materials from a variety of formats. Overrides can be specified in the pipeline.

Detailed documentation is pending, but please consult the [Reference](#reference).

### Supported formats

- `jpg`
- `png`
- `gif`
- `webp`
- as well as other common image formats

## Audio

Detailed documentation is pending, but please consult the [Reference](#reference).

### Supported formats

- `ogg`
- `wav`
- `mp3`

## Reference

See `rustdoc` for a complete reference of supported pipelines, model importers, material configurations,
and the like.
