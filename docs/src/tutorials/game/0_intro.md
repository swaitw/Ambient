# Tutorial: Building a game from scratch

In this tutorial, our goal is to write a simple third-person shooter game and to demonstrate the capabilities of Ambient.

During this, we will show you the basic features of the engine, providing resources such as documentation, reference, examples, games, and more. At the end of the tutorial, you should have an understanding of how to use Ambient to make your own game.

If you run into any problems with the tutorial, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient/issues/new) or [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/ambient) and let us know.

## Prerequisites

To start with, you will need to install Ambient. Follow the documentation on [how to install](../../user/installing.md) (note that you will need to return to this page after installation).

If you are new to Rust, you can learn the basics of the language from [the official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn). However, the API is designed to be easy to use, so you should be able to follow along even if you are new to Rust.

> Tip: If you prefer other methods for installation, see [here](../../reference/advanced_installing.md).

For the best experience, we recommend configuring your IDE for Ambient (see [here](../../user/setting_up_ide.md)).
