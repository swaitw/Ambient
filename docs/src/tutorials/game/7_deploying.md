# Chapter 7: Publishing your game

So you've got a small game built and want to share it with a friend. How do we do that?

Easy! All you need to do is run:

```
ambient deploy
```

> **Note**: The first time you run it, it will raise an error that will tell you to create your user account and to generate and use an API token. Follow the instructions in the error message to do so.

Once your game is deployed, you can just go to the web URL provided and play it from there. You can send the URL
to a friend, and they can join you there as well!

If a `screenshot.png` is present in the package's directory, it will be used as the game's thumbnail on the Ambient website. We recommend you include one.

> **Tip**: Deploying with `ambient deploy` will deploy to the Ambient servers. For more deployment options, including your own game servers, see the [reference documentation on distribution](../../reference/distributing.md).
