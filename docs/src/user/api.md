# API

## Reference documentation

The full API reference for Ambient can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/ambient_api).

Note that the published API may not be up to date with the latest Git commit of the runtime - if you are using bleeding-edge features, you will need to document the API yourself using `cargo doc -p ambient_api` in the `guest/rust` folder.
