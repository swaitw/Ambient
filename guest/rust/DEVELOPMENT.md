# Development

## Documentation

To see the documentation as it will appear on docs.rs, use

```sh
cargo campfire doc api [-- --open]
```

from the root directory of the repository.

The "feature boxes" are a nightly-only feature, but docs.rs builds with nightly.
This command mirrors the configuration that docs.rs uses.
