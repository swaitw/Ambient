# Hide cursor

This package will lock and hide the cursor when there is no focus on any UI element. It will also respond to the "Escape" key press by setting focus to `Nothing`, consequently disabling cursor locking and hiding.

Typically, this package is used in combination with something like the `third_person_controller` package.
