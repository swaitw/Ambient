# ambient_ui

A UI library for [Ambient](https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient). Built on top of [ambient_element](https://crates.io/crates/ambient_element).

Ambient's UI system is heavily inspired by React (with hooks), and follows many of the same patterns.
Take a look at the [React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react) to learn how hooks work in general.
